# 96 days project

Simple GUI application to track daily notes from **1 September** to **1 December 2025** with a sleek, Appleâ€‘style interface. The
UI now uses San Francisco fonts and a macOS-inspired dark palette.

## Requirements
- Python 3

## Usage
Run the application:

```bash
python memento_mori.py
```

Select a day in the grid, edit the note in the editor and press **Save**. Days with notes display a small dot. Notes are stored in the `saves/` folder and loaded automatically at startup.
